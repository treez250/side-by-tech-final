        "designSummary": "**The Silent Architect: An Elegant Fusion of Swiss Precision and Serene Minimalism**\n\nThe Vision: To project an image of quiet confidence and sophisticated expertise, the design will embody the principles of both the Swiss Grid and Serene Minimalism. This fusion creates a website that is both highly structured and exceptionally spacious, conveying a sense of timeless quality and meticulous attention to detail. The layout will be clean, balanced, and devoid of unnecessary ornamentation, allowing the content to speak for itself.\n\n**Execution Blueprint:**\n1. The 12-Column Foundation: A strict 12-column grid will provide the underlying structure for all content. However, elements will not be confined to the grid, but rather strategically placed to create visual interest and hierarchy.\n2. Whitespace as a Design Element: Generous whitespace will be used to create a sense of calm and sophistication. Margins and padding will be carefully considered to ensure that each element has ample room to breathe.\n3. Typographic Harmony: A classic serif font (Cormorant Garamond) will be used for headings to convey authority and elegance, while a clean sans-serif font (Lato Light) will be used for body text to ensure readability.\n4. Subtle Accents: A muted color palette of off-whites, greys, and deep blacks will be used to create a sense of understated luxury. A single, subtle metallic color (soft gold) will be used sparingly as an accent for key interactive elements.",

This fusion creates a website that is both highly structured and exceptionally spacious, conveying a sense of timeless quality and meticulous attention to detail. The layout will be clean, balanced, and devoid of unnecessary ornamentation, allowing the content to speak for itself.\n\n**Execution Blueprint:**\n1. The 12-Column Foundation: A strict 12-column grid will provide the underlying structure for all content. However, elements will not be confined to the grid, but rather strategically placed to create visual interest and hierarchy.\n2. Whitespace as a Design Element: Generous whitespace will be used to create a sense of calm and sophistication. Margins and padding will be carefully considered to ensure that each element has ample room to breathe.\n3. Typographic Harmony: A classic serif font (Cormorant Garamond) will be used for headings to convey authority and elegance, while a clean sans-serif font (Lato Light) will be used for body text to ensure readability.\n4. Subtle Accents: A muted color palette of off-whites, greys, and deep blacks will be used to create a sense of understated luxury. A single, subtle metallic color (soft gold) will be used sparingly as an accent for key interactive elements.",
